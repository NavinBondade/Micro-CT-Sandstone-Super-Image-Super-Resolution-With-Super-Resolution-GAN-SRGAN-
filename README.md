<p>Low-resolution data is a major problem, it acts as a major hurdle for tasks that we can perform with such datasets such as image classification and object detection. This problem is very much evident in geological research, acquisition of high-resolution data is generally limited because of hardware limitations of systems. To address this issue, I have developed a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) model and trained it effectively. This sophisticated deep learning model excels at upscaling 64x64 pixel images to a higher and detailed resolution of 256x256 pixels, significantly enhancing the quality and utility of the data for geological analysis, and overcoming the limitations of hardware constraints.</p>

<h2>What is Super Resolution GAN?</h2>
<p>Super-resolution GAN applies a deep network in combination with an adversary network to produce higher-resolution images. During the training, A high-resolution image (HR) is downsampled to a low-resolution image (LR). A GAN generator upsamples LR images to super-resolution images (SR). We use a discriminator to distinguish the HR images and backpropagate the GAN loss to train the discriminator and the generator.</p>
<p>It uses a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, the authors use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space.</p>

<h2>Model Details</h2>
<p>The model was rigorously trained on a comprehensive dataset of sandstone micro-CT images for 30 epochs. The dataset included downscaled images of sandstone with dimensions of (64,64,3) and their corresponding upscaled versions with dimensions of (256,256,3). To guide the model's learning, a combination of binary cross-entropy and mean squared error loss functions was employed. Additionally, the Adam optimizer was utilized to efficiently update the model's parameters, ensuring convergence towards optimal performance.
